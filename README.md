# Deployment plan

During the development phase, the EduMindSolutions app will be hosted locally to allow testing, debugging, and faster iteration. The backend, developed with Django REST Framework, and the frontend, built with React, will run on a local server environment to enable quick updates and testing before public release.

For production, the application will be deployed on Render, which will host both the backend API and the PostgreSQL database, while the frontend will be served from the same platform for simplicity. This setup ensures reliability, scalability, and secure data handling as the project grows.
